Amazon like MYSQL and Node app

Node.js & MySQL

# Overview

In this activity, you'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this week. 

Make sure you save and require the MySQL and Inquirer npm packages in your homework files--your app will need them for data input and storage.


# Instructions


Challenge #2: Manager View (Next Level)

This Node application is called bamazonManager.js. Running this application will:
List a set of menu options:
View Products for Sale
View Low Inventory
Add to Inventory
Add New Product
If a manager selects View Products for Sale, the app will list every available item: the item IDs, names, prices, and quantities.
If a manager selects View Low Inventory, then it will list all items with an inventory count lower than five.
If a manager selects Add to Inventory, your app will display a prompt that will let the manager "add more" of any item currently in the store.
If a manager selects Add New Product, it will allow the manager to add a completely new product to the store.
